        Morpheous Gaming: Terms and Conditions
      </h1>
      <p className="text-white mb-4">
        Welcome to Morpheous Gaming! We’re thrilled to have you on board. Before you dive into the action, please take a moment to review our Terms and Conditions. These are here to ensure a fun, fair, and secure experience for everyone.
      </p>
      <p className="text-white mb-6">
        By using Morpheous Gaming, you agree to these terms. Let’s get started!
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-600 mb-4">1. Who Can Join?</h2>
      <ul className="text-white list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li>Players must be at least 16 years old to participate.</li>

      <ul className="text-white list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li>One account per player—simple and fair! Creating multiple accounts for unfair advantages isn’t cool and could get you banned.</li>
        <li>Keep your login details safe. Your account, your responsibility!</li>
        <li>If you think someone else is using your account, let us know right away so we can help.</li>

      <ul className="text-white list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li>Tokens are your key to entering tournaments. You can buy them directly on our platform.</li>
        <li>All token purchases are final and non-refundable, so think carefully before you buy.</li>
        <li>Any suspicious or fraudulent payment activity will lead to account suspension—play fair!</li>

        <li>Follow the rules of each tournament—it’s the best way to keep the competition fun for everyone.</li>
        <li>If you’re part of a team, the team captain handles registration and makes sure all players know the rules.</li>
        <li>Cheating, hacking, or exploiting game mechanics isn’t just against the rules—it’s against the spirit of gaming. Offenders will be disqualified.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-600 mb-4">5. Play Nice! (Code of Conduct)</h2>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-600 mb-4">8. Technical Issues</h2>
      <ul className="text-white list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li>Sometimes, things don’t go as planned. If there are server outages or connectivity issues, we’ll do our best to fix them, but we’re not responsible for how they might affect your participation.</li>
